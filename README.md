# logitech-led-lync-status

This project came about because I wanted to use my Logitech G933 headset at work, and thought having the LEDs mirror my Skype for Business status would be helpful to coworkers who needed my attention. It's a nice single-day project  for learning the Logitech LED SDK, as well as the Lync 2013 Client SDK.

Have fun!
